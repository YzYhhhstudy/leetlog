**Auto-capture your LeetCode grind into local Markdown notes — Obsidian-ready, you only write the insights.**

![demo](docs/demo.svg)

The moment you **type your first keystroke** on a problem, the timer starts. Every submission is
counted. The moment you get **Accepted**, your code, runtime stats and timing land in a structured
Obsidian note. Revisiting an old problem? The same note accumulates every attempt — see exactly
what past-you was thinking.

## Why not existing tools?

| | LeetHub family | Timer extensions | LeetPlug | **LeetLog** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Archive accepted code | ✅ pushes to GitHub | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ into local notes |
| Auto timing (from first keystroke) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Submission / AC counts | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Re-attempt history | ❌ | ❌ | partial | ✅ |
| Space for your own insights | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ core design |
| Where your data goes | GitHub | local | third-party server | **never leaves your machine** |

## How it works

```
LeetCode page
  │  interceptor.js — hooks fetch/XHR: captures your code on submit,
  │                   polls the judge result; detects first keystroke
  ▼
content.js ──POST──▶ local bridge  127.0.0.1:8763  (leetlog_server.py)
                          │  resolves problem metadata, times the session,
                          │  counts submissions, assembles Markdown
                          ▼
            your-vault/LeetCode/0013-roman-to-integer.md
```

No DOM scraping (breaks on every UI redesign). LeetLog intercepts the network layer instead:
the submit request already contains your code; the judge endpoint returns Accepted/runtime/memory.
Result polling is dual-channel: the classic `/check/` endpoint, with GraphQL `submissionDetails`
as fallback. **Everything flows `leetcode.com page → 127.0.0.1 → local files`. Nothing is uploaded.**
In folder mode the extension skips the bridge entirely and writes the notes itself.

## Install (~2 minutes)

The **browser extension alone is enough** — it captures your practice and can write the
Markdown notes straight into any folder. Bridges (Obsidian plugin / Python server) are
optional upgrades for deeper integration.

### 1. Install the browser extension

**The Chrome Web Store listing is in review** — a one-click install link lands here once
it's approved. Until then, load it unpacked:

Chrome / Edge / Arc: `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** →
select the `extension/` folder.

### 2. Choose where notes are written (pick one)

**Option A — folder mode (simplest, zero extra software)**

In the extension's **⚙️ Options** page, switch to **folder mode** and pick any folder —
your Obsidian vault's `LeetCode/` subfolder works great. The extension writes the Markdown
notes directly via the browser's File System Access permission. Nothing leaves your machine.

**Option B — Obsidian plugin bridge (in-app notices, settings UI, legacy-note import)**

In Obsidian: **Settings → Community plugins → Browse** → search **"LeetLog Bridge"** →
Install → Enable — or open [obsidian.md/plugins?id=leetlog-bridge](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=leetlog-bridge).
Port, notes folder and note template language (English / 中文) live in the plugin settings.
Auto-updates through Obsidian.

**Option C — Python server (works without Chrome folder permissions or Obsidian)**

```bash
python3 server/leetlog_server.py
```

Zero dependencies (Python stdlib). First run auto-detects your Obsidian vault and writes
`~/.config/leetlog/config.json` (edit vault path / note folder there).

Bridges share port 8763 — run at most one; folder mode needs neither.

# 13. Roman to Integer

> [!abstract]- Problem
> Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols… *(statement auto-captured
> into a folded callout — read your mistake notebook offline, on the subway)*

🎬 [YouTube: Roman to Integer explained](…) *(video-solution search links land right below
the statement — Bilibili too for leetcode.cn problems)*

## Attempt 1 · 2026-07-03 Fri
⏱ start 10:34 → first submit 10:42 · coding 8 min → AC 10:49 · 2 submits / 1 AC · 6 runs · 15 min on problem

### ✅ Accepted · python3 · 10:49 (12 ms · 17.1 MB)
> [!success]- Code
> ```python
> class Solution: ...
> ```

*(each AC keeps its heading in the outline; the code itself sits in a callout that is
folded by default — expand only what you want to reread)*

````

The frontmatter is designed for Obsidian Properties / Dataview — one query gives you a
"mistake notebook", "problems untouched for 30+ days", or per-tag accuracy.

**Ready-made dashboards** — copy [`templates/`](templates/) into your vault:

- [`leetlog.base`](templates/leetlog.base) — **Obsidian Bases** (core feature, 1.9+, works on
  mobile, no plugin needed): mistake notebook, spaced-repetition due list, rusty problems,
  all-problems table grouped by difficulty
- [`leetlog-dashboard.md`](templates/leetlog-dashboard.md) — Dataview version with extras Bases
  can't do yet (per-tag accuracy aggregation, totals paragraph); requires the Dataview plugin
- [`leetlog-review-queue.md`](templates/leetlog-review-queue.md) — Dataview spaced-repetition
  queue (1/3/7/14/30-day intervals stepped by attempt count)

## Import your legacy notes

Years of hand-written notes in one giant markdown file? Split them into LeetLog's
one-file-per-problem format:

**In Obsidian** (LeetLog Bridge ≥ 0.3.6): command palette → **Import legacy notes** →
pick the file → review the split plan → Import. Or from the terminal:

```bash
python3 server/lc_import.py my-old-notes.md --dry-run   # preview the split plan
python3 server/lc_import.py my-old-notes.md             # do it (or pass a folder of .md)
```

A heading is recognized as a problem if it contains a leetcode.com/.cn problem link,
a problem number ("13. Roman to Integer", "LC146 …", "#13"), or an exact English title.
Everything until the next recognized heading goes with it — into a new note (metadata
auto-filled) or **appended** to the existing LeetLog note (your captured attempts are never
touched). Idempotent: re-running skips already-imported sections. Unrecognized headings are
listed for manual review, never guessed. `--site cn` makes created notes link to leetcode.cn.

## Optional cloud sync (beta)

Local-first stays the default — nothing is uploaded unless you opt in. In the extension's
**⚙️ Options** you can pair with **LeetLog Cloud** (private beta) using a one-time pairing
code. It adds, on top of your local notes:

- **Automatic mistake notebook** — problems ranked by "stuck signals" (WA rate, debug
  intensity, coding time), each score explainable
- **Spaced-repetition flashcards** (1/3/7/14/30-day intervals) with email reminders;
  the extension badge shows today's due count
- **Cross-site aware**: solved the same problem on both leetcode.com and leetcode.cn?
  Cards and tables show bilingual titles (Two Sum · 两数之和) with links to both sites
- Anki export, personal stats dashboard

Cloud sync is independent of the local bridge — either, both, or neither.

## Timing semantics

```
⏱ start 11:10 → first submit 11:18 · coding 8 min → AC 11:25 · 2 submits / 1 AC · 20 min on problem
   ↑ first keystroke   ↑ first submit   ↑ keystroke→submit   ↑ first Accepted     ↑ keystroke→leave/switch
```

- **Coding time** = first keystroke → first submit (your real "solving" time)
- **Time on problem** = first keystroke → closing the page / switching to another problem
  (includes post-submit review & optimization)
- Keep optimizing after AC: code blocks append, counters accumulate
- **Run** (non-submit) executions are counted too — per-attempt in the ⏱ line, cumulative
  in `total_runs` (debugging intensity is a review signal)
- Coming back within 6 hours counts as the same attempt; later opens "Attempt N+1"
- 🌐 Note template language: English or 中文 (Obsidian plugin setting / `lang` in the Python config)

## Session rules

- Judge results come through two channels: after capturing the `submission_id`, the extension
  polls `/check/`, falling back to GraphQL `submissionDetails` — no DOM dependency
- Server restarts don't lose state (`~/.config/leetlog/state.json`)
- Solving while the bridge is down? Events are buffered in the extension's offline queue
  (toolbar badge shows the count) and replayed with their original timestamps once the
  bridge is back — timing stays accurate, nothing is lost

## Known limits

- Relies on LeetCode's current submit endpoints (`/submit/` + `/submissions/detail/<id>/check/`);
  far more stable than DOM scraping, but an API overhaul would need an interceptor update
- Chrome 111+ (content script MAIN world)
- leetcode.cn is fully supported (verified end-to-end); the statement capture prefers the Chinese translation there

## Roadmap

**v0.3 (current)**: extension (0.6.x) + three interchangeable writers — the **LeetLog Bridge
Obsidian plugin** (live in the community marketplace, currently 0.3.5), the Python server,
and extension-only folder mode. Optional cloud sync in private beta. Verified end-to-end on
production leetcode.com and leetcode.cn. Chrome Web Store listing in review.

**Next**
- [x] **Extension-only mode**: pick a folder once in the Options page, the extension
      writes Markdown directly via the File System Access API — no bridge, no Obsidian required
- [x] Offline queue in the extension: buffer events in `chrome.storage` when the bridge is
      down, replay on reconnect (original timestamps preserved) — never lose a session

**Features**
- [x] Chrome Web Store — submitted, in review · [ ] Firefox port
- [x] Capture the problem statement into the note as a folded callout (offline reading)
- [x] Dataview index templates — see [`templates/`](templates/)
- [x] Count Run (non-submit) executions (`total_runs` + per-attempt ⏱ line)
- [x] Video-solution links under the statement (YouTube; Bilibili for leetcode.cn)
- [x] Optional cloud sync: auto mistake notebook, SRS flashcards, due-count badge (beta)
- [x] Cross-site bilingual titles when the same problem is done on .com and .cn
- [x] `lc import`: split legacy hand-written notes into per-problem files (`server/lc_import.py`)
